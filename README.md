# Test-Minimization-in-Big-Data
JTEOH: This is no longer relevant. It was an initial implementation of PathEffect/Constraint -> Python function string generation based on the master branch (which is not integrated with JPF). 

`python-def-jteoh` is the intended branch which is applied on top of JPF-based changes. However, it may be merged differently.

This current branch (`python-function-def` is likely to be deleted in the near future).
